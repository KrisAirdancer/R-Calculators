## Calculators

**Other**
``` {r}
# Total number of outcomes:
  # Multiply the number of outcomes for each event together (RedBook p12)
# "Digits" are any numerals from 0 to 9. That is, 0 through 9 are all digits.
```

**Expected Value**
``` {r}

probs1 = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.6)
vals1 = c(5000000, 1000000, -1000000)
probs2 = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.4)
vals2 = c(3000000, 1000000, -1000000)
probs3 = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.2)
vals3 = c(6000000, 0, -1000000)

# Expected value of 1
expVal1 = sum(vals1*probs1)

# Expecte4d value of 2
expVal2 = sum(vals2*probs2)

# Expecte4d value of 3
expVal3 = sum(vals3*probs3)

```


**Bernoulli Distribution**
``` {r}


```

**Binomial Distribution**
``` {r}
probOfSuccess = 0.96 # Probability of getting a question correct, etc.
probSize = 13 # Total number of questions answered, etc.
numTrials = 13 # Number of questions answered correctly, etc.

# Success on less than numOfTrials
LTNumTrials = c(0 : numTrials - 1)
sum(dbinom(LTNumTrials, probSize, probOfSuccess))

# Success on numTrials or less
LEQNumTrials = c(0 : numTrials)
sum(dbinom(LEQNumTrials, probSize, probOfSuccess))

# Success on exactly numOfTrials
dbinom(numTrials, probSize, probOfSuccess)

# Success on numOfTrials or more
GEQNumTrials = c(numTrials : probSize)
sum(dbinom(GEQNumTrials, probSize, probOfSuccess))

# Success on greater than numOfTrials
GTNumTrials = c(numTrials + 1 : probSize)
sum(dbinom(GTNumTrials, probSize, probOfSuccess))
